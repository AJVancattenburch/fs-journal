**<u>Week One - Day 2 - HTML Structure</u>**
<br>
<b></b>

<ul>
  <li> "Link:favicon" allows you to adjust the icon in the "title" area of the document. </li>
  <li> Try your best to not over-complicate the amount of sections you are breaking up in your HTML structure! </li>
  <li> The "flex-grow" property in combination with the parent element being set to a <b>min-height: 100vh</b> allows you to flex the last child element to the bottom of the viewable height of the page. </li>
  <li> The "flex" display property only applies to that element and it's immediate child; no further. </li>
  <li> "Ctrl+p" will let you jump between files in vsCode. </li>
  <li> "Ctrl+tab" switches between each concurrent window in vsCode. </li>
  <li> The "flex-wrap" class helps have a nicer display on mobile devices. </li>
  <li> You can bring up all the flex properties and their interactions with specific elements by looking in the class section of DevTools. </li>
  <li> <b>"span" underneath an "img" or "logo icon" tag</b> will allow you to type a message next to it.</li>
  <li> "Gap" can be used as a class property for a customizable "space-between". </li>
  <li> For the <b>box-sizing</b> properties, you typically need them to help with margins between box spacing by using <b>border-box</b> and <b>content-box.</b> </li>
  <li> The <b>article</b> tag is typically the parent tag for a <b>paragraph</b> element, or another similar document type.</li>
  <li> You can set how many <b>"Lorem"</b> characters are typed by immediately following Lorem with a <b>number value.</b> </li>
  <li>
    The <b>"offset"</b> tool helps to offset a <i>column</i> by however many you choose.
    
    (e.g. col-11 gets offset-1, col-10 gets offset-2, etc.)
