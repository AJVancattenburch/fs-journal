# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | I do not remember the answer to this question. |

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | Export default handles a single instance of a class while Export handles multiple conditions of said class. |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | <b>Encapsulation</b> is what you hide from the user in your code in an additional layer. |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | But upon what I was able to gather from what I could watch in the "Advancing with JavaScript" videos, it is a side of MVC we have not discussed that I don't have any sound knowledge on to describe what it does. |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | A class is the main model we are building around in MVC, and the instance of that class is further built on inside our constructors in the MVC. |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | It is what describes the properties of the class being built to show us the result of what it is. |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | To break down your code into organized and readable layers to structure it for ease of readability/workability. It also protects it by "russian dolling" your code into several layers that go deeper.  |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | To handle all of the interacting controls integrated in your project. For example; when a button is clicked, the action that takes place thereafter. |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The controller is like the waiter in a restaurant, and the Service layer is like what the cooks do in the kitchen to build what that model will look like. It handles the service side of the project by constructing what will happen once a controller has set properties for what will happen when a button is clicked. The service is the final step to how that will be handled in perspective of the "users" view. |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The model is the initial area where the structure of the rest of your project is dignified and to get a visualization of what will happen for the remainder of the project. If the controller is like the a waiter, and the service is like the cooks in the kitchen -- the model could be represented as the menu that we will observe and refer back to as we build the rest of our project. |
